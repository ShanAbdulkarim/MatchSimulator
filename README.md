# MatchSimulator
This is a match simulator that is created with node js backend and a react frontend. It links the 2 using axios and prints out the results of the game with scorers, possession stats and shot stats. The main purpose of this project is to show my skill in passing information from mongo databases and working with backend and frontend applications.
